## Notes

- What is a microfrontend?
    - Micro-frontend architecture is a design approach in which a front-end app is decomposed into individual, semi-independent “microapps” working loosely together. The micro-frontend concept is vaguely inspired by, and named after, microservices.
- What are the benefits of microfrontends?
    - Some advantages include reduced maintenance demands, faster and more efficient development cycles, and reduced complexity when implementing changes.
- Module Federation?
    - Webpack Module Federation makes sharing code and dependencies between different code bases easier. This architecture loads the code dynamically at runtime to reduce the frequency of code duplication, and the host application only downloads the missing dependencies, if any
